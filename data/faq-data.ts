        question: "What is Lysiom and how does it work?",
        answer:
          "Lysiom is a platform where users can propose solutions to real-world unsolved problems across various disciplines. The platform lists major unsolved challenges, allows users to submit solution articles, uses community upvoting to identify promising proposals, conducts peer review of top solutions, and creates opportunities for university funding of verified solutions. An integrated AI assistant helps users with their research process.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is Lysiom's approach to using AI in research?",
        answer:
          "While using AI-generated content is often considered a red flag in traditional academic contexts, Lysiom takes a different approach. Due to current advancements in generative AI, we believe these technologies can help us solve humanity's most challenging unsolved problems. Our platform encourages thinking out of the box and beyond current boundaries—users can leverage AI to solve problems and even introduce new theories. The key is using AI as a tool to extend human creativity and problem-solving capabilities, not replace them.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does Lysiom work with universities and support commercialization?",
        answer:
          "Lysiom collaborates directly with universities and qualified peer reviewers to identify the most breakthrough solutions. We help connect promising solutions with appropriate academic partners for publication in respected journals. Additionally, we provide pathways to commercialize verified solutions in later steps, creating a bridge between theoretical innovation and real-world implementation. This complete pipeline—from problem identification to potential commercialization—distinguishes Lysiom from traditional academic platforms.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is Lysiom different from existing academic platforms?",
        answer:
          "Unlike traditional academic platforms, Lysiom specifically focuses on unsolved problems, incorporates community voting to surface promising solutions, provides AI research assistance, and creates direct pathways to potential university funding. It combines academic publishing, crowdsourced evaluation, and research funding in one ecosystem.",
      },
      {
        question: "What disciplines does Lysiom cover?",
        answer:
          "Lysiom covers unsolved problems across all major scientific and academic disciplines, including Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Environmental Science, Engineering, Chemistry, Economics, Psychology, Social Sciences, and more.",

        question: "How do I participate in Lysiom?",
        answer:
          "Anyone can browse problems and read solutions. To submit your own solutions or participate in voting, you'll need to create an account. For peer review activities, academic or professional credentials in relevant fields will be required.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after I submit a solution?",
        answer:
          "Your solution becomes visible on the problem's leaderboard where community members can upvote it. If it reaches the top five based on upvotes, it undergoes peer review by qualified experts in the field. Solutions that pass peer review receive verification badges and become eligible for potential university funding.",
      },
      {
        question: "What criteria are used to evaluate solutions?",
        answer:
          "Peer reviewers evaluate solutions based on scientific validity, methodological rigor, innovation, feasibility, potential impact, quality of supporting evidence, and clarity of presentation. Verification doesn't necessarily mean the problem is completely solved, but that the solution makes a significant, valid contribution.",

        question: "Do I retain intellectual property rights to my solutions?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you retain intellectual property rights to your original contributions. By submitting, you grant Lysiom a non-exclusive license to publish and display your work. You can publish verified solutions elsewhere, though some journals may have policies regarding prior publication.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does the funding mechanism work?",
        answer:
          "Verified solutions are showcased to university research departments and funding organizations looking for innovative approaches. Interested funders can contact solution authors directly through the platform. While Lysiom increases visibility to potential funders, it cannot guarantee that any solution will receive funding.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How does the AI chatbot assist with research?",
        answer:
          "The AI research assistant helps you understand problems, explore relevant literature, plan your methodology, structure proposals, find references, and refine your writing. It serves as a research aid rather than a solution generator, providing guidance while encouraging original thinking.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is my solution expected to be AI-generated?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you are free to use AI and think outside the box! Using the extreme power of AI tools is exactly the aim of the platform—to step forward and tackle these unsolved problems in innovative ways. Unlike traditional academic platforms that restrict AI use, Lysiom encourages leveraging generative AI capabilities to their fullest extent. You can use AI to generate new theories, analyze data in novel ways, or propose unconventional solutions that might not emerge from traditional thinking. The focus is on solving problems and advancing knowledge, regardless of whether the breakthrough comes from human insight, AI assistance, or a powerful combination of both.",
